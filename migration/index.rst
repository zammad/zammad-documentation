Migrating to Zammad
*******************

Zammad will migrate the following information:

   * Tickets and their Articles
   * Groups / Queues
   * Organizations
   * Agents and Customers (if applicable)

After migrating to Zammad you'll want to continue with the 
:doc:`/getting-started/first-steps` to configure Zammad. This has to be 
done *after migration*.

Limitations
===========

There might be source dependent limitations which we will be covering on the direct migration pages. 

However, these limitations count for all migrations:

   * Migrations are only possible on new instances.
   * Migrations are only possible from **one sources**.
     Several migration sources on one instance are *not* supported.
   * Zammad can't migrate object types it doesn't know, migrations will fail.
   * Zammad migrates **all or nothing**. This means that you can't deselect
     specific information specific groups, tickets or users.
