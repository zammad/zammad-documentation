Limitations
===========

Please note below Zendesk specific limitations.
These are additional limitations to the
:ref:`general ones listed <migration_limitations>`.

   * | Differential migrations are **not** supported!
     | The general suggestion is to run a test import before to learn
       how long the migration is going to take.
   * **Important:** Please note that migration speed highly depends on your
     Zendesk plan (API rate limits apply).
   * Your Zendesk plan has to provide API support. This may not apply to all
     available plans.
   * User passwords are not migrated and will require the user to use the
     :admin-docs:`password reset link </settings/security/base.html#lost-password>`
     on the login page.

Prerequisites
=============

Zammad requires API access which is why you'll need to `create an API key`_
for the migration. The migrator will request your Zendesk-URL, email address and
API key.

.. warning::

  Ensure to retrieve the API key with a **full administrator** account.
  Less privileged users will end in a broken migration.

.. _create an API key:

Importing Zendesk data
========================

Generally you have two options on how to migrate data.
If you have a fairly big instance with a lot of data, you may want to
consider using the console over the browser version.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Via browser

      After installing Zammad and configuring your 
      :doc:`webserver </getting-started/configure-webserver>`, navigate to your
      Zammads FQDN in your browser and follow the migration wizard.

      Depending on the number of users, tickets and Zendesk plan this may take
      some while.

         :alt: Migration process of Zendesk via UI

      .. note:: **ðŸ˜– Scheduler got interrupted**

         .. figure:: /images/migration/zendesk/scheduler-interrupted.png

         If this message appears after providing your credentials, please be
         patient. The migration should start within 5 minutes.

         If you receive above message after the migration begun, please
         consider using the console approach instead and reset the
         installation.

   .. tab:: Via console

      .. include:: /migration/includes/rails-console-migrator-hint.include.rst

      To prepare the migration, run the following commands
         .. code-block:: ruby
            :force:

            # Set variables for easier settings
            $ subdomain = '{zendesk url}'
            $ email = '{zendesk admin email address}'
            $ token = '{zendesk token}'

            # Update Zammad settings for Zendesk import
            $ Setting.set('import_zendesk_endpoint', "https://#{subdomain}/api/v2")
            $ Setting.set('import_zendesk_endpoint_username', email)
            $ Setting.set('import_zendesk_endpoint_key', token)
            $ Setting.set('import_backend', 'zendesk')
            $ Setting.set('import_mode', true)

         If you want to know if your configuration works in a dry run,
         run the following command:

         .. code-block:: ruby

            Sequencer.process('Import::Zendesk::ConnectionTest')

      To start the actual migration, run the following commands
         .. code-block:: ruby
            :force:

            # That the actual job
            $ job = ImportJob.create(name: 'Import::Zendesk')
            $ AsyncImportJob.perform_later(job)

         .. tip::

            **ðŸ¤“ Want to check the state of the migration?**

            Running the following command in a rails console will provide
            detailed state information of your migration.

            .. code-block:: ruby

               pp ImportJob.find_by(name: 'Import::Zendesk')

            To give you an idea how the migration job state looks like, you can
            use below tabs. As long as ``finished_at`` is ``nil``, the process
            is still running.

            .. tabs::

               .. tab:: Freshly started import

                  .. code-block:: ruby

After migration
===============

As the migration technically skips the getting started wizard, please
note that you want to adjust your
:admin-docs:`FQDN settings </settings/system/base.html>` (FQDN & HTTP-Type).

.. include:: /migration/includes/how-to-login.include.rst

After successfully migrating your Zendesk instance,
continue with :doc:`/getting-started/first-steps`.
