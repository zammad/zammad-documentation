Feedback or contact forms are quite often use cases on web pages. Usually they will generate an email which is sent to somebody who forwards it and so on. With Zammad it’s quite easy to integrate these forms into your website and directly generate tickets from them. In just 2 minutes.

Go to "Admin -> Channels -> Form" and enable the switch for this feature. Below you can adapt your form settings.
