Install on CentOS via RPM
*************************

Currently we support RHEL7 & CentOS7.


Add Zammad & epel-release RPM repos and install RPM
===================================================

::

 sudo yum -y install epel-release
  sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/zammad.repo \
    https://dl.packager.io/srv/zammad/zammad/develop/installer/el/7.repo
  sudo yum install zammad

Go to http://localhost and you'll see:
===========================================

* "Welcome to Zammad!", there you need to create your admin user and invite other agents.


Change your webserver configuration (non localhost connections):
=================

Add your fully qualified domain name or public IP to server name directive in your web server configuration and restart your web server.
The installer will give you a hint where Zammad's web server config file is located.

nginx
--------

*/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/zammad.conf*

::

 server {
     listen 80;

     # replace 'localhost' with your fqdn if you want to use zammad from remote
     server_name localhost;


You can manage the Zammad services manually:
===========================================
