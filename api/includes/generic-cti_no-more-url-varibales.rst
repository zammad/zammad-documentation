🙏 Sorry, but we've decided to remove URL variable samples that were
documented since Zammad 3. The main reason is that they're a pain
to read, understand and maintain.

*This does not mean they're no longer supported. If you must, have a look at the
curl samples for form-data methods as they're similar.*

Please stick with either form-data or JSON variants.
