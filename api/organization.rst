Delete
======

Required permission: ``admin.organization``

.. danger:: **âš  This is a permanent removal**

   Please note that removing organizations cannot be undone.

   Removing organizations with references in e.g. activity streams or users
   is not possible via API - this will be indicated by
   ``"error": "Can't delete, object has references."``. This is *not* a bug.

   Consider using `Data Privacy`_ via UI for more control instead.
