Delete
======

Required permission: ``admin.group``

.. danger:: **âš  This is a permanent removal**

   Please note that removing groups cannot be undone.

   Removing organizations with references in e.g. activity streams or tickets
   is not possible via API - this will be indicated by
   ``"error": "Can't delete, object has references."``. This is *not* a bug.

   Consider setting affected groups to inactive instead or ensure to move all
   existing tickets to new groups.
