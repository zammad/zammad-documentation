.. warning::

   Restoring old backups may overwrite your ``database.yml``.
   You can find out if that's the case by having a look into the file
   ``.tar.gz`` within the ``config`` directory. If you can see a
   ``database.yml`` there, ensure to save the original version
   **before restoring**.

   If you found the trap already, you can try the :ref:`reset_db_password`.
