Troubleshooting Backup & Restore
********************************

Errors have been made, possibly they can be corrected through.

Exit codes
==========

Backup & Restore script come with exit codes to help you within possible
autonomous handling. However, we do not guarantee a complete error handling.

Beside the exit codes, there's also error messages returned to standard out.

.. list-table:: Exit code list
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Code
     - Description / Situation
   * - ``0``
     - The script finished successfully (or the error is not handled).
   * - ``1``
     - This is a general error. Most often used for script aborts due to
       incorrect information provided or information missing.
   * - ``2``
     - There was an error with database handling.
       This usually either happens if your database server does not meet script
       requirements, login data being invalid or â€žbrokenâ€Ÿ database dumps.
   * - ``3``
     - There were issues with file / folder permissions.

Classics
========

Here's some classics you may encounter.

.. hint:: **ðŸ¥¸ Your issue is not listed...?**

   Please consult the `Zammad Community`_ for technical assistance.

``password authentication failed`` -or- ``peer authentication failed``
   This indicates that the password of your Zammad DB user is either different
   from your ``database.yml`` or the wrong database server may be contacted.

   â€žBut my Zammad instance is running, how can it be wrong?â€Ÿ
      Zammad may fall back to socket connection which is why you didn't notice.

   What to do ...
      * Ensure that the provided user credentials are correct

           .. tip:: **ðŸ¤“ Lazy users can use our helper**

              In the backup directory you'll find a :ref:`reset_db_password`.

``Ident authentication failed for user``
   This indicates your database server does require ``ident`` authentication.
   That authentication method is not supported by our scripts.

   What to do ...
      Check ``pg_hba.conf`` of your PostgreSQL-Server and adjust it if needed.

      Usually authentication can be allowed like so:

      .. code-block:: sh

         # THIS IS A SAMPLE AND MAY NOT FIT YOUR ENVIRONMENT
         host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
         host    all             all             ::1/128                 md5

      Please consult the offical `PostgreSQL documentation`_ for this, as this
      is out of our documentation scope.

.. _PostgreSQL documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/

``WARNING: You don't seem to have any attachments in the file system!``
   This indicate you've set ``FULL_FS_DUMP`` to ``no`` but your instance
   currently does not save attachments to file system.

   This warning will be shown once before creating an empty directory to allow
   the backup process to continue successfully.
