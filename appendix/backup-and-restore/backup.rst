--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   ðŸ¤“ Before running your first backup, please have a look at
   :doc:`/appendix/backup-and-restore/configuration`.

In general, running a Zammad backup is as simple as running

.. code-block:: sh

   $ /opt/zammad/contrib/backup/zammad_backup.sh

Please make sure to test the backup function manually with the user
you're planning the backup first. This ensures that your backup really
is running as expected.

Remarks
   | The backup script can be either run as ``zammad`` or ``root`` user.
   | Stopping Zammad is not required (but suggested) technically, but may be in
     your use case!
   | (Keep in mind that a running Zammad instance keeps changing data which may
     be an issue during long backup runs)
