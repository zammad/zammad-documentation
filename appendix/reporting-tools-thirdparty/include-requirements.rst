   * (read) access to your Elasticsearch index

      .. warning::

         Never expose Elasticsearch to the public if you're not sure how to
         do it. Especially **never** without authentication! Zammad stores
         **very sensitive** information within the Elasticsearch Index.
   * a Zammad instance (version 4 or above) that supports your use case
