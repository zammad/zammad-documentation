Console
*******

Zammad uses Ruby on Rails so you can make use of the `rails console`_.

.. _rails console:
   http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html

.. warning:: 

   Please double check your commands before running, as some of those commands
   might cause data loss or damaged tickets! If you're unsure,
   **use a test system first**!

To open the rails console on the shell you have to enter the following commands.

Start Zammad's Rails console
============================

Running a single command
------------------------

The following command will allow you to run a single command, without running
a shell (e.g. for automation).

.. note:: Replace ``{COMMAND}`` with your command you want to run.

.. tip::

   If you enter a ``p`` in front of your command
   (e.g. like ``rails r 'p Delayed::Job.count'``),
   you'll actually receive a printed output (without you won't!).

.. code-block:: sh

   # package installation
   $ zammad run rails r '{COMMAND}'

   # source installation
   $ rails r '{COMMAND}'

.. _rails_shell:

Running several commands in a shell
-----------------------------------

The following command will provide you a rails console.
It allows you to run several commands inside it.

This reduces loading times greatly.

.. include:: /admin/console-rails-shell.include.rst

.. hint:: **Starting Rails Console in Safe Mode**

   Normally, starting rails console requires certain
   :doc:`third-party services </prerequisites/software>` to be up and running.
   You may receive errors and console will refuse to start in case they are not
   available.

   However, it's possible to start rails console in safe mode by setting
   :ref:`a special environment variable <safe_mode>`. With
   ``ZAMMAD_SAFE_MODE=1`` set, availability of these services will be ignored.

   .. tabs::

      .. code-tab:: console Package Installation

         $ ZAMMAD_SAFE_MODE=1 zammad run rails c
         Zammad is running in safe mode. Any third-party services like Redis are ignored.

         There was an error trying to connect to Redis via redis://localhost:6379.
         Please provide a Redis instance at localhost:6379 or set REDIS_URL to point to a different location.
         ＃<Redis::CannotConnectError: Error connecting to Redis on localhost:6379 (Errno::ECONNREFUSED)>
