Install on Kubernetes via Helm
******************************

.. warning:: We currently do not support Kubernetes installations in productive
   use.

Kubernetes_ (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications.

.. _Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io

For maintainability reasons, this documentation does not cover the installation
instructions because these are included in our helm chart anyway. You can find
the helm chart in the zammad-helm repository
`here <https://github.com/zammad/zammad-helm/blob/main/zammad/README.md>`_.
