Install on Kubernetes
*********************

.. hint::

   We do not provide support in terms of Kubernetes specific problems.
   If you choose to run Zammad via Docker, support is only provided for the Zammad application.

You can find installation instructions
`in the documentation of our helm chart <https://github.com/zammad/zammad-helm/blob/main/zammad/README.md>`_.
