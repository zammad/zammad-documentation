Install with Docker Compose
***************************

.. warning::

   We currently do not support Docker environments in productive use.
   It's no problem if you run Zammad on docker, however, support is only
   provided for Zammad as application!

   Docker Compose environments require deeper system know how.
   If you're not too familiar with Docker and the way it works, you may want
   to stick with :doc:`the package installation </install/package/>` instead.

Docker is a container-based software framework for automating deployment of
applications. Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications.

Zammads docker images are hosted on `Dockerhub`_.

.. _Dockerhub:
   https://hub.docker.com/r/zammad/zammad-docker-compose/

.. hint::

   By default, docker compose will use a fixed Zammad version like
   ``6.2.0-1``, which refers to a specific commit. In this scenario,
   you are responsible to apply updates by updating the version on your own.

   Alternatively, you can also use floating versions that will give you automatic updates
   via ``docker compose pull``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      # VERSION=6.2     # all patchlevel updates
      # VERSION=6       # including minor updates
      # VERSION=latest  # all updates of stable versions, including major
      # VERSION=develop # bleeding-edge development version (not recommended for production use)


Before you start, make sure to have at least 4 GB of RAM to run the containers.

Install Docker Environment
==========================

This documentation expects you already have a working Docker Compose
environment. You can find the required documentations for these steps below:

   * `Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_
   * `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_

Getting started with zammad-docker-compose
==========================================

   /install/docker-compose/environment

Step 1: Clone GitHub repo
-------------------------

.. warning::

   If you're updating Zammad, below commands will cause values set in ``.env``
   and ``docker-compose.override.yml`` to be lost. You're expected to check
   if the ``docker-compose.yml`` has changed and if so to adjust it accordingly.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/zammad/zammad-docker-compose.git
   $ cd zammad-docker-compose

.. hint::

   If cloning is too much of a hassle, you can also download the files from
   https://github.com/zammad/zammad-docker-compose/releases. This will make sure
   file permissions are preserved.

Step 2: Setting vm.max_map_count for Elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------------

Even with running Elasticsearch in a container, you're required to adjust your
host's settings to ensure a clean runtime.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

Step 3: Adjust Environment as needed
------------------------------------

In some cases our default environment is not what a docker-compose user is
looking for. To remove complexity from this page, we outsourced information on
this topic.

See :doc:`/install/docker-compose/environment`

Step 4: Start Zammad using DockerHub images
-------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   Before starting your containers ensure to not use default login data for
   your Zammad database! See Step 3!

.. code-block:: sh

   $ docker compose up -d

.. hint:: **ðŸ”§ How to run rails/rake commands in containers**

   The docker entrypoint script sets up environment variables required by Zammad
   to function properly. That is why calling ``rails`` / ``rake`` on the console
   should be done via one of the following methods:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ docker compose run --rm zammad-railsserver rails r '...your rails command here...'

   This will run the command via the docker entrypoint and is recommended.

   Alternatively, you can run the rails console interactively by running:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ docker compose run --rm zammad-railsserver rails c

   In case you require the use of ``docker exec``, you can use the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ docker exec zammad-docker-compose-zammad-railsserver-1 /docker-entrypoint.sh rails r '...your rails command here...'

   This will manually invoke the docker entrypoint and pass the desired command
   to it for execution in the proper environment.

   If you need to retrieve information from the rails server, you can place
   for example ``pp`` (pretty print) in front of your rails command. This
   leads to an output in your terminal.
