Docker Compose Environment Variables
************************************

Zammad's Docker Compose supports several environment variables that are not 
set by default. The best way to provide these is within the file ``.env``.

In case our default ``docker-compose.yml`` is not good enough, please use
``docker-compose.override.yml`` to provide own changes.

.. note::

   Unless stated other wise, below environment variables count for the whole
   Zammad stack and not single containers. Below grouping is to help you find
   them better, but do not reflect their container.
