Zammad can't communicate with external systems
----------------------------------------------

In rare cases (sometimes even right after installation), Zammad won't be able
to communicate with e.g. external Email servers. Simply restart the Zammad app
in the App Center module in the UCS management system and it should be enough
to get it back working.
