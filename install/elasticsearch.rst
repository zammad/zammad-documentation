Set Up Elasticsearch
====================

Zammad's search function can be powered by Elasticsearch (which is **highly
recommended**).

.. include:: /install/includes/hosted-services.rst

.. note:: Some steps may be required depending on your Elasticsearch version and
   configuration. See remarks in the configuration steps below.

Step 1: Installation
--------------------

Elasticsearch offers different versions. Currently, the versions 7 and 8
are supported by Zammad. For installation instructions, you should first and
foremost follow
`Elastic's installation documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.x/setup.html>`_.
Use the dropdown in the top left corner to choose which version you want to
install.

However, if you want go with Elasticsearch 7 (which is slightly easier to
install), you can find the consolidated installation steps below.
Be aware that the maintenance of version 7 might be stopped earlier than for
later versions, which also come with some additional security features.

.. hint:: If you are installing Elasticsearch 8 and want to follow our
   standard configuration in step 2, make sure to copy/save the password which
   is shown while installing Elasticsearch.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Ubuntu/Debian

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ apt install apt-transport-https sudo wget curl gnupg

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | \

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Deb822 format

            In this tab, the repository is added by using the
            `deb822 format <https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html>`_.
            If you run a distribution which doesn't support it, use the legacy
            format instead.

   .. tab:: Direct Download

      Find the latest release on the
      `downloads page <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch>`_,
      or see the
      `installation guide <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html>`_
      for in-depth instructions. Ensure to also install the fitting
      (and mandatory!) attachment plugin for elasticsearch, if installing
      version 7.

      Install the attachment plugin:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment

      Increase the virtual memory map limit:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

After you installed Elasticsearch and its attachment plugin,
ensure to enable it by default and start it.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ systemctl start elasticsearch

.. code-block:: sh

   $ systemctl enable elasticsearch

.. note:: üêã **Docker installations on macOS/Windows:**

   Setting the ``vm.max_map_count`` kernel parameter requires
   `additional steps <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/docker.html#_set_vm_max_map_count_to_at_least_262144s>`_.

Step 2: Configuration
---------------------

Install ingest-plugin (only for Elasticsearch <= 7)
   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install ingest-attachment

Increase virtual memory map limit
   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

Adjust ``/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml``
   We use the following settings to optimize the performance of our Elasticsearch
   servers. You may want to append that to your ``elasticsearch.yml`` as a useful
   basic configuration.

   .. code-block:: sh

      # /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

      # Tickets above this size (articles + attachments + metadata)
      # may fail to be properly indexed (Default: 100mb).
      #
      # When Zammad sends tickets to Elasticsearch for indexing,
      # it bundles together all the data on each individual ticket
      # and issues a single HTTP request for it.
      # Payloads exceeding this threshold will be truncated.
      #
      # Performance may suffer if it is set too high.
      http.max_content_length: 400mb

      # Allows the engine to generate larger (more complex) search queries.
      # Elasticsearch will raise an error or deprecation notice if this value is too low,
      # but setting it too high can overload system resources (Default: 1024).
      #
      # Available in version 6.6+ only.
      indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 2000

Enable and start Elasticsearch
   .. code-block:: sh

      $ systemctl start elasticsearch

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ systemctl enable elasticsearch

.. _configure_zammad_with_elasticsearch:

Step 3: Connecting Zammad with Elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------

Before proceeding here, make sure to install Zammad before running below
commands, as this will fail otherwise.

* Install from :doc:`package <package>`
* Install with :doc:`docker <docker-compose>` (the default stack already includes Elasticsearch)

.. note::
   This guide uses the ``zammad run`` command prefix in command line examples.
   This prefix is only applicable to package installations.
   Check the :doc:`console guide </admin/console>` for more information.

Elasticsearch URL
   Set the Elasticsearch server address; adapt it to your scenario.

   Elasticsearch 7:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_url', 'http://localhost:9200')"

   Elasticsearch 8:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_url', 'https://localhost:9200')"


Elasticsearch user and password (only for Elasticsearch >= 8)
   Now you need your password which was shown to you while installing
   Elasticsearch.

   Set Elasticsearch user:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_user', 'elastic')"

   Set Elasticsearch password:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_password', '<password>')"

Add certificate to Zammad (only for Elasticsearch >= 8)
   Show and copy the auto-generated certificate from Elasticsearch and add it
   to Zammad. Make sure to copy/paste the delimiters
   (e.g. ``-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----``) too.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo cat /etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt

   Go to the admin panel of Zammad and add your copied certificate under
   :admin-docs:`SSL Certificates </settings/security/ssl-certificates.html>`.

   .. figure:: /images/install/elasticsearch/admin-certificate-management.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows certificate management in Zammad's admin panel
      :align: center

.. _es-rebuild-searchindex:

Build/rebuild the searchindex
   .. hint::
      - The rebuild may take many hours or even days, if a lot of data is
        already present in a productive environment. However, you can safely
        run this during operating times without the risk of loosing data. As a
        downside, it could lead to reduced performance and that some data may
        not be shown in search results.
      - Consider specifying a number of CPU cores to be used for the rebuild
        (see example below).

   Without specifying CPU cores:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo zammad run rake zammad:searchindex:rebuild

   Example with specifying 8 CPU cores:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo zammad run rake zammad:searchindex:rebuild[8]


Optional settings
-----------------

We collected some useful settings you may want to apply. For further
information please have a look at
`Elastic's documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html>`_.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Index namespacing

      Useful when connecting multiple services or Zammad instances
      to a single Elasticsearch server (to prevent name collisions during indexing).

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_index', Socket.gethostname.downcase + '_zammad')"

   .. tab:: File-attachment indexing rules

      Zammad supports searching by the contents of file attachments,
      which means Elasticsearch has to index those, too.

      Limiting such indexing can help conserve system resources.

      .. code-block:: sh

         # Files with these extensions will not be indexed
         $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_attachment_ignore',\
           [ '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.mpeg', '.mpg', '.mov', '.bin', '.exe', '.box', '.mbox' ] )"

         # Files larger than this size (in MB) will not be indexed
         $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_attachment_max_size_in_mb', 50)"

   .. tab:: Remote host

      Change your Elasticsearch URL if you have a separate Elasticsearch server.
      Default is ``localhost``.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_url', 'https://example.com')"

   .. tab:: SSL Verification

      You can define if a SSL verification will be performed. Default is
      ``true``.

      .. code-block:: sh

         # Deactivating SSL verification is NOT recommended
         $ zammad run rails r "Setting.set('es_ssl_verify', false)"

      If you want to use custom certificates, you can find information about
      how to use them in Zammad
      :admin-docs:`here </settings/security/ssl-certificates.html>`.

   .. tab:: Asciifold

      By default, the
      `Asciifold <https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/text-analysis/analysis-asciifolding-tokenfilter>`_
      feature of Elasticsearch is enabled. This can be useful if you deal with
      text which includes diacritics and/or umlauts.

      In case you need a more exact search, you can turn it off via
      :ref:`rails console <disable-asciifold>`.
