Install from Source
===================

.. include:: /install/includes/hosted-services.rst

The source installation is the most difficult installation type of Zammad.
If you're not too experienced with Linux and system configuration and don't
want to use Zammad's cloud service, try another installation type:

   * :doc:`/install/package`
   * :doc:`/install/docker-compose`

We decided to remove the instructions to install Zammad from source from this
documentation because of better alternatives for production deployments.

However, if you want to install it from source, you can follow our
`developer manual <https://github.com/zammad/zammad/blob/develop/doc/developer_manual/development_environment/how-to-set-up-a-development-environment.md>`_
in the Github repository. You can also find instructions there about how to
configure your development environment when using a Mac.
