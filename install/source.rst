Install from Source
===================

.. include:: /install/includes/hosted-services.rst

The source installation is the most difficult installation type of Zammad.
If you're not too experienced with Linux and system configuration and don't
want to use Zammad's cloud service, try another installation type:

   * :doc:`/install/package`
   * :doc:`/install/docker-compose`

You can find the
`developer manual <https://github.com/zammad/zammad/blob/develop/doc/developer_manual/development_environment/how-to-set-up-a-development-environment.md>`_
in the Github repository. You can also find instructions there about how to
configure your development environment when using a Mac.
