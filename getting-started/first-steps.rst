First steps
***********

After successfully installing Zammad you'll have a couple of options.

   * :doc:`Migrate from a supported source </migration/index>`
   * :ref:`Restore Zammad from an existing backup <restore_zammad>`
   * Start from scratch (move on to the next section)

Getting Started Wizard
----------------------

If you visit Zammad's web page the first time, you'll be greeted by its
Getting Started Wizard. It will guide you through the first most important
things.

   About this section: Below part uses definition list instead of field lists
   intentionally. It's supposed to safe width for better readability.

Step 1: Create your very first administrator account
   The fields should be fairly self explaining.

   .. note::

      Zammad does require the following password security by default:

         * Password length of 10 or more
         * 2 upper and 2 lower characters
         * contains at least one digit

Step 2: Provide company information
   You can upload a custom logo fitting to your company here.
   The instance address is detected automatically and only required adjustment
   in case it's detected wrong.

   All of these settings can be changed within
   :admin-docs:`Branding </settings/branding.html>` and
   :admin-docs:`System </settings/system/index.html>` settings.

Step 3: E-Mail notification channel
   By default Zammad uses sendmail - if that doesn't fit you can change it to
   SMTP here.

      .. warning::

         Zammad uses ``noreply@<your-fqdn>`` as sender address by default.
         SMTP setups might fail - you may want to skip this step with choosing
         ``sendmail`` at this point. You can adjust it later!

Step 4: Your first email channel (optional)
   If you want to start right away, you can connect your email account already.

      .. warning::

         Zammad reacts to fetched emails by default.
         If that's not what you want, skip this step for now.

   Learn more about the email channel within the documentation for
   :admin-docs:`email channels </channels/email/index.html>`.

After finishing the wizard you'll be automatically logged in to the just created account.

Further Steps
-------------

In our opinion the next step order would like below sample.
You can skip parts you don't need or adapt. All parts are described within
:admin-docs:`Zammad's admin documentation </>`.

   #. Configure your required groups
   #. Adjust triggers as needed
   #. Add postmaster filters if needed
   #. Configure SLAs if needed
   #. | add email / social media channels & signatures
      | (go back to group settings to add outgoing email addresses)
   #. Add Text Modules
   #. Add Organizations
   #. Configure roles if needed
   #. Consider Third Party logins or LDAP integration for easier logins
   #. Add agent accounts (users)
   #. Consider backup strategies for Zammad, see
      :doc:`/appendix/backup-and-restore/index`

From point 5 on you'll be able to work productive in theory. ðŸ™Œ
